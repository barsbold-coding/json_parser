# Light weight JSON parser

Light weight json parser that is written on pure c language.

---

## Purpose

I'm creating this library to learn more about the JSON format and how to parse it. I'm also using this as an opportunity to learn more about C and how to create a library.

## Scripts

There is 2 scripts that make easier the process of building and syncing with the remote repository.

* `build`
Usage of the build script is easy. To build this library you should run the following command:
```bash
./scripts/build
```
and it will create dist folder to store single main binary file. And you can add `-e` flag to execute the binary file immedietly after building.
* `sync`
